# CS 3GC3 - Assignment 2

## Instructions to Compile

Run `make robot` to compile `robot.cpp` and run `Robot` for Part A, `make solarsystem` to compile `solarsystem.cpp` and run `SolarSystem` for Part B, or `make` to compile and run Part A followed by Part B.

## Additional Features in Part A

- Keyboard controls to supplement all possible menu options (arrows to move robot, page up/down to turn robot left/right, numbers 1-5 to change grid size, home to reset position, end to randomize position)

## Additional Features in Part B

- Implemented three basic added functionalities instead of two: zoom controls, change speed of planets/moons, change size of planets/moons
